# Motion Profile Testing

This is the code written to test different formulas and algorithms for calculating motion profiles as well as trajectories. 
This does not aply to any robotics competition and is simply a calculator meant for testing different formulas and algorithms, as well as documenting them for future use.

## Building the project

This project requires Visual Studio to build. MORE HERE LATER.
